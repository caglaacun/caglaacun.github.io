Baby me, Birmingham, UK in 1989

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Knowledge Discovery and Web Mining Lab with [Dr. Olfa Nasraoui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SGscZDgAAAAJ&hl=en) at University of Louisville. Currently, I am doing research in explainability in machine learning to make black box machine learning algorithms more transparent and trustworthy by developing a novel model-agnostic framework to explain black-box machine learning algorithms.
